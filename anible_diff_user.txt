INSTALLING ANSIBLE WITH DIFFERENT USERS
1. launch 3 ubuntu instances and name them manager,node1,node2
2. run below commands on all instances:
	apt update
	apt-get update


   NOW FOLLOW BELOW STEPS ON MANAGER NODES (STEP 3 TO 7):
3. create user (name = user0) and set password (redhat@123) while creating user.
	adduser user0

4. set password authentication to yes (it is set to no bydefault)
   vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
    PasswordAuthentication no
    #PermitEmptyPasswords no
  
    we will change this PasswordAuthentication from no to yes.

    # To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
    PasswordAuthentication yes
    #PermitEmptyPasswords no

now we will save this file.


5. Restart sshd service to enable changes:
 	systemctl restart sshd

6. Now we will give sudo rights to user0 by making its entry in 90-cloud-init-users. This is an already created file under /etc/sudoers.d
	vim /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users


        # Created by cloud-init v. 19.4-33-gbb4131a2-0ubuntu1~18.04.1 on Thu, 14 May 2020 04:57:38 +0000

      # User rules for ubuntu
        ubuntu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL


we will write the entry for user0 in this file, so that it will have sudo rights.



      # User rules for ubuntu
       ubuntu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
       user0  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

   
now save and exit.


7. Now we will restart sshd service once more:
	systemctl restart sshd




8. NOW WE WILL CREATE USER (user1) IN NODE1, MAKE ITS ENTRY IN 90-cloud-init-users ,SET passwordAuthentication FROM no TO yes IN sshd_config under /etc/ssh/
   AND RESTART sshd SERVICE.
	adduser user1
	vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

	vim /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users
        # User rules for ubuntu
        ubuntu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
        user1  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL


	systemctl restart sshd


9. NOW WE WILL CREATE USER (user2) IN NODE2, MAKE ITS ENTRY IN 90-cloud-init-users ,SET passwordAuthentication FROM no TO yes IN sshd_config under /etc/ssh/
   AND RESTART sshd SERVICE.
        adduser user2
        vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

        vim /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users
        # User rules for ubuntu
        ubuntu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
        user2  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL


        systemctl restart sshd


NOW WE HAVE CREATED USERS . NOW WE WILL ESTABLISH SSH CONNECTION. FOR THAT WE WILL CREATE ssh key AND COPY THIS KEY IN BOTH NODES AND CHECK THE SSH CONNECTION.

RUN BELOW COMMANDS ON MANAGER (FROMM STEP 10 TO STEP 13) :

10. ssh-keygen

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:6evLkWyTS2VPRVD7Bmwghuoi3Y+owe0FVfFIvJZapQw root@manager
The key's randomart image is:

root@manager:~#

11. copying this key from manger to node1
	ssh-copy-id user1@52.66.235.105  (this is the public ip of node1)

/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

user1@52.66.235.105's password:

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'user1@52.66.235.105'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

12.ssh user1@52.66.235.105

user1@node1:


12. ssh-copy-id user2@13.232.125.30
13. ssh user2@13.232.125.30

NOW SSH HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND ALL NODES CAN COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER.

NOW WE WILL INSTALL ANSIBLE,PYTHON AND PYTHON-APT ON MANAGER NODE:

RUN BELOW COMMAND ON MANAGER NODE:
14. apt update
15. apt-get update
16. apt install ansible
17. apt install python
18. apt install python-apt

RUN BELOW COMMAND ON NODE1 AND NODE2:
19. apt update
20. apt-get update
21. apt install python
22. apt install python-apt   

NOW ALL PREREQUISITS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED ON MANAGER AND MANAGED NODES.

NOW WE WILL GO TO MANAGER, LOGIN VIA user0:
23. su user0
24. cd /etc/ansible
25. ls -lrt
total 24
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   982 Sep  5  2017 hosts
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 19315 Apr 19  2018 ansible.cfg

here are two files: 1. hosts: in this file , we will mention the ip addresses,ansible users and configurations  of our managed nodes.
		    2. ansible.cfg : it is the default file created after installing ansible having all configuration.

26.  sudo vim /etc/ansible/hosts

# This is the default ansible 'hosts' file.
#
# It should live in /etc/ansible/hosts
#
#   - Comments begin with the '#' character
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - Groups of hosts are delimited by [header] elements
#   - You can enter hostnames or ip addresses
#   - A hostname/ip can be a member of multiple groups
-
-
-
-
-
-
-# leading 0s:

#db-[99:101]-node.example.com

NOW WE WILL MENTION IP ADDRESSES AND ANSIBLE USERS OF OUR MANAGED NODES IN A GROUP (test-servers)

[test-servers]
172.31.15.253 ansible_user=user1
172.31.7.120 ansible_user=user2

# This is the default ansible 'hosts' file.
#

NOW WE WILL GIVE CREATE A FILE (.ansible.cfg) UNDER /etc/ansible AND WE WILL DEFINE THE ADDRESS OF OUR INVENTORY (/etc/ansible/hosts) IN THIS FILE. 
27. sudo vim .ansible.cfg

[defaults]
inventory=/etc/ansible/hosts




NOW WE WILL CREATE .vimrc FILE UNDER /home/user0 FOR INDENTATION.
28. sudo vim .vimrc

set ai
set ts=2
set shiftwidth=4
set expandtab

~
NOW WE WILL CREATE A yml FILE FOR PLAYBOOK UNDER /home/user0:
29. sudo vim myplaybook.yml

- name: this is my playbook to install and run apache
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: install apache webserver
      apt:
       name: apache2
       state: latest
    - name: start the apache service
      service:
       name: apache2
       state: started
    - name: create index.html file
      copy:
       src: /home/user0/index.html
       dest: /var/www/html/index.html


NOW WE WILL PERFORM DRY RUN :
30. sudo ansible-playbook -C myplaybook.yml

NOW WE WILL EXECUTE OUR PLAYBOOK:
31. sudo ansible-playbook myplaybook.yml -b

above command will install and start apache webserver in manged nodes.
If we browse the public ip of node1 and node2 we will see below content :

hi this is ansible testing
